The basic structure of (a) the GMSE modelling framework and its default order of operations with the genetic algorithm (GA) modelling the decision-making process of both users and manager, and (b) the adaptation of the GMSE framework to accommodate the model-game approach presented here. The grey boxes represent the various GMSE submodels, with the arrows representing the process links between them. The yellow boxes and circles are the adapted components in the model-game adaptation, with player interaction replacing the manager model in GMSE, and the underlying GA for the manager - the GA is still used to make user decisions. Grey circles indicate the order of operations in each.","label":"unnamed-chunk-1"},"document_id":"8D380CEC","chunk_id":"czfxfwfwwxir1","chunk_label":"unnamed-chunk-1"}],"doc_write_time":1632388855}
